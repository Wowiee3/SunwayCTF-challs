Description: You need a valid key to get the flag. 'Valid' and 'correct' aren't the same thing, though...
It's recommended to use a disassembler/debugger for this challenge.

Medium difficulty rev challenge. Release a screenshot of the obfuscated source code as a hint midway through the competition.

Solution: Valid keys can be made with a keygen. The sum of all ascii characters in the key must equal up to 407. Original key: ECCO2K.
flag: sunctf{not_the_only_1}
