Description: Guess the price of your nasi kandar order to win a flag

Solve: Bypass "admin" username check with any variation of "admin" such as "Admin" because MYSQL is case-insensitive to login. Serialize a cookie guessed_price with the base64 version of Plate class with its public attribute $price set to true boolean value to bypass the loose comparison, $guessed_price == $boss_calculation.
