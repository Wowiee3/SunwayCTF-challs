I assume you paid attention during cryptography classes?

```
key = 826cf418f07f78cb9bb37685f880cc3f
iv = 38fa8037d3043190c361499c0416c814
encrypted_flag = 03c30a5cc2ced7bc178f936bafae65342422edace2a127ae830d7c6c69a56d4aff052a325602f896b2770ee0374dba92
```

Flag: `sunctf{l34rn_y0ur_AES_b4s1cs_1n_cl4ss}`

A straightforward AES-CBC challenge, you can decrypt the flag with CyberChef or a script (attached in the repository)
