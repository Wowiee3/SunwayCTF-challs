desc: A cocky ctf player from Saitama waits for his train with a cheeky grin until a gust of wind whispers "If you're so good at OSINT... you can do this with your eyes closed."

Find the name of the station he is at.
Note: The flag is the station's wikipedia title/name with spaces replaced with underscores "_".
If the station is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urawa_Station](Urawa Station), the flag will be: sunwayCTF{Urawa_Station}
